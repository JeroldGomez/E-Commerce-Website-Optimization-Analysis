# E-commerce Website Optimization Analysis

Hello there! I've recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, and I've gained valuable insights and skills that I'm excited to put into practice. Through the course's learning structure: *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share & Act*. This learning path serves as my guide as I navigate through the data, ensuring a systematic and insightful approach.

I'll walk you through how I approached the e-commerce website optimization case study. For this project, I've chosen to utilize the powerful combination of RStudio and Tableau, leveraging the strengths of both tools to dive deep into the data.

### Case Study Track B

For Track B, I had the freedom to choose my own questions and dataset. In this case study, I focused on optimizing the conversion rates of an e-commerce website.

### Scenario

He has asked you to lead a project for a brand new client â€” this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.
