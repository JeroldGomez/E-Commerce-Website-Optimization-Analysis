# E-commerce Website Optimization Analysis

Hello there! I've recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, and I've gained valuable insights and skills that I'm excited to put into practice. Through the course's learning structure: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share & Act**. This learning path serves as my guide as I navigate through the data, ensuring a systematic and insightful approach.

I'll walk you through how I approached the e-commerce website optimization case study. For this project, I've chosen to utilize the powerful combination of RStudio and Tableau, leveraging the strengths of both tools to dive deep into the data.
